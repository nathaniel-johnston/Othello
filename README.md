# Othello
This is a university project which uses an Arduino Uno and Omega2 board to create an automated version of the classic board game "Othello". The game is played with an 8x8 grid of RGB LEDs. There are three buttons, one to to scroll through the available moves, another to scroll through the moves in reverse order, and one to select the move you wish to make. Shown below is a .gif of the game working.

In this case, blue is the human player, green is the computer player, yellow is the available moves, and red is the cursor for the player to select which move they want to do:

The MiniMax algorithm was used for the computer player to determine the best move to make. The computer was quite good at the game and could beat most people who played against it.
